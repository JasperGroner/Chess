This is simply a boilerplate version of our Express-React-Objection apps that you can use to play around! 


### Getting Started

```no-highlight
et get express-react-objection-boilerplate
cd express-react-objection-boilerplate
createdb express-react-objection-boilerplate_development
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

The application is fully configured, but comes with no routes, migrations, models or React components (beyond App.js).

Feel free to use this for side-projects or study!
